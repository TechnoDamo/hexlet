# Intorduction
Server-side environment is usually managed throught terminal which provides text-based interface for interacting with machine.
It may first seem archaic, but text-based communication with computers have several benefits:
- significantly saves resources 
- allows to automate any actions
- provides virtually unlimited access to system's capabilities
- generally opens more possibilities in many programs


# Operating Systems
## How the command line came into being
**Unix** - an operating system, born in 1970s, firstly designed to run on mainframes.
One of the key features of Unix was multi-user mode.
Unix turned out very successful, but it was closed-source.
Later, they were systems based on unix, but they weren't backward compatitable, which made it very difficult, so, the POSIX was born. <br/>
**POSIX** *(Portable Operating System Interface for Unix)* - family of standards specified to maintain compatibility between Unix-like operating systems.
## Linux Operating System
**Linux** - operating system kernel. <br/>
![Unix history](./img/unix_history.png)
Linux is not used in its pure form, because you need several components to have a full-fledged OS.
These are called distributions.
A distribution includes:
- Linux kernel itself
- GNU programs
- Utilities for installing and configuring linux
- Support for regular updates of the kernel and its environment

# Command line
To work with command line, we need two things:
- terminal
- command line shell
## Terminal
**Terminal** - program that emulates the behavior of a hardware terminal consisting of a keyboard and a monitor.
## Command shell
**A command shell** - a program through which a user or administrator manages the operating system and installed programs using the command line.
![terminal illustration](./img/terminal.png)
*The terminal is just a program that runs the command shell inside itself*

The command shell is often called a **REPL** *(Read-Eval-Print-Loop)*.
